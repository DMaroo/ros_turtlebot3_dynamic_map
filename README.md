# ros_turtlebot3_dynamic_map
Project files I created while I was learning turtlebot3 and navigation using ROS

***CAUTION:*** This is by no means "good code" or industry code. These files are just the project files I was working with when I was learning turtlebot3. Some of the code might even be ugly and subpar, however, my main focus while working on this project was to learn rather than deliver polished code.
